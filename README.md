optimization of chaos-based image encryption
This project is about optimization of chaos-based image encryption using Genetic algorithm
1. divide each image to four part
2. permutation of each part of the image pixels by logistic function (chaos function) and make n population
3. confuse of each part of the image pixels for each population by logistic function
4. crossover the population together and use Genetic algorithm to find the lowest correlation
5. present the lowest correlation encrypted image as final encrypted image.
